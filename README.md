**How Does Vana Mind Work?**
----------------------------

The makers of Vana Mind claim to have developed the formula after two years of pre-clinical trials. During those trials, the manufacturer identified the ideal blend of cannabinoids, essential oils, natural terpenes, and MCT oil to help promote inner peace no matter what life throws at you.

The main active ingredient in Vana Mind is CBD oil. Derived from hemp extract and with less than 0.3% THC per serving, CBD oil is legal across the United States and has been linked to various benefits and effects.

Many people take CBD oil sublingually every day to promote inner peace. For example, putting a few drops of Vana Mind and other CBD oils under your tongue can promote a healthy stress response.

Vana Mind also contains full-spectrum CBD oil. Some CBD oils contain isolated CBD oil. Isolated CBD oil may be more concentrated. However, studies show full spectrum oil contains terpenes, alkaloids, and hundreds of other natural chemicals from the hemp plant that contribute to the active effects of CBD. You can release serotonin, boost mood, and improve overall well-being.

Beyond full spectrum CBD Oil, Vana Mind contains a significant dose of cannabinol or CBN. CBN is another natural cannabinoid in the hemp plant linked to its own effects on anxiety, stress, and overall wellness.

Rounding out the Vana Mind formula are MCT oil and essential oils. MCT oil helps to hold the formula together and boost absorption, while essential oils promote stress and anxiety relief on their own.

### **How to Use Vana Mind**

Mind & Body Naturals recommends taking two to four drops of Vana Mind under your tongue twice or thrice daily. According to the manufacturer, each bottle of Vana Mind lasts around one month.

Here’s how to use Vana Mind:
----------------------------

Place 2 to 4 drops of Vana Mind under your tongue

**Take 2 to 3 times per day**

According to Mind & Body Naturals, you should notice a rapid decrease in stress after using the formula. You can also adjust the dosage based on your needs, increasing or decreasing the dosage as needed.

According to the official website, each bottle of Vana Mind contains 2,250mg of CBD, which is considered a very strong dose per serving (around 150mg per 1mL). In comparison, many CBD gummies contain 5mg to 20mg of CBD per gummy.

Vana Mind Ingredients
---------------------

According to the official website, Vana Mind contains a blend of active ingredients, including CBD oil, natural plant-based essential oils, and MCT oils. Each of these ingredients contributes a different active effect to Vana Mind.

**Active ingredients in Vana Mind include:**
--------------------------------------------

Full Spectrum Cannabidiol (CBD) Oil: The most important active ingredient in Vana Mind is full spectrum CBD oil. According to the manufacturer, the CBD in Vana Mind can promote overall health and wellness. Each bottle of Vana Mind contains 2,250mg of CBD, or around 150mg of CBD per 1mL serving, which is considered a solid dose and much higher than competing CBD tinctures. Typically, you need a large bottle of CBD oil to get a dose of 2,250mg per bottle.

Full-spectrum CBD contains terpenes, cannabinoids, and other natural chemicals from the hemp plant to support overall health and wellness. Studies show these ingredients have an “entourage effect,” working together to contribute to the active effects of CBD – more than you would get with CBD isolate.

Cannabinol (CBN) Oil: In addition to 2,250mg of cannabidiol (CBD), Vana Mind contains 650mg of cannabinol (CBN). Cannabinol is another natural chemical in the hemp plant linked to various effects. It has mild psychoactive properties, for example, and agonizes CB1 and CB2 receptors – similar to how CBD works. Early research on CBN has connected it to anxiety, stress response, and general wellness.

Many people take essential oils daily for health, wellness, relaxation, and stress relief. Essential oils have been shown to soothe the body from the inside out and outside in. Whether smelling or consuming essential oils, these ingredients could contribute to various health and wellness effects. Some people use lavender essential oil for relaxation, while others use lemongrass essential oil to help them fall asleep at night. Essential Oils: Vana Mind contains an undisclosed selection of essential oils.

MCT Oil: Vana Mind uses MCT oil, or medium-chain triglyceride oil, as a base. MCT oil is packed with fatty molecules that could make it easier for your body to absorb the active ingredients in Vana Mind. Instead of struggling to absorb CBD and essential oils, your body could get a higher dose of all active ingredients. The fatty molecules can also help the active ingredients pass through your stomach acid and digestive tract to reach the intended destination. Vana Mind and many other CBD oils use MCT oil as a base. It stabilizes the formula, keeps it together, and ensures you get the maximum dose of CBD oil you’re paying for.

Alkaloids, Terpenes, & Other Complementary Ingredients: The makers of Vana Mind claim that alkaloids, terpenes, and other natural chemicals in full-spectrum CBD oil contribute to active effects of their own. The alkaloids, for example, “help release serotonin,” a feel-good neurotransmitter in your brain. When you have high levels of serotonin, you tend to feel better. Alkaloids can also boost mood and improve well-being by influencing other neurotransmitters.

Overall, the goal of the active ingredients in Vana Mind is to help promote inner peace no matter how stressful life gets.

Start using Vana Mind and feel less stressed!

**Scientific Evidence for Vana Mind**
-------------------------------------

Mind & Body Health, the maker of Vana Mind, claims to have developed the supplement based on 100 research studies and two years of pre-clinical trial research. Below, we’ll review some evidence supporting CBD and CBN’s effects on stress and anxiety.

A 2015 study proposed cannabidiol (CBD) as a potential treatment for anxiety disorders. Researchers reviewed the evidence and found there was strong support for using CBD for generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, for example. However, researchers cautioned there was little formal research analyzing the best dosing for CBD.

A similar study found CBD could help you sleep by targeting anxiety. In that study, researchers found CBD could help with some neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Evidence suggests CBD works by calming the central nervous system, which could help with these disorders while promoting a night of better sleep.

New research on cannabinol (CBN), another cannabinoid in the hemp plant, is linking it to similar effects to CBD. In a 2022 study, for example, Salk researchers found CBN preserved mitochondrial function and prevented oxidative damage to cells, helping it protect against brain cells and manage inflammation. Because of these effects, researchers suggested CBD could promote mental clarity and even help with degenerative brain conditions like Alzheimer’s.

Some people use essential oils daily for stress. In a 2015 study, for example, researchers found essential oils could help with stress and anxiety via aromatherapy. Other studies have linked specific essential oils – like lavender – to better responses in high-stress situations. Although Mind & Body Naturals does not disclose the particular essential oils in Vana Mind, it’s possible these essential oils could help with the stress response.

Overall, Vana Mind contains a blend of CBD, CBN, and other natural ingredients to promote health and wellness. By taking Vana Mind daily, you can give your body a blend of essential oils, terpenes, MCT oil, and other ingredients to promote health and wellness.
